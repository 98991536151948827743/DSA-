1. What Java Is ??

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language.

Created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (1995).

Famous for the slogan: “Write Once, Run Anywhere.”

Runs using the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which makes Java code portable.


2. How Java Works (Execution Flow)

You write code → MyProgram.java

Compiler (javac) converts it → MyProgram.class (bytecode)

JVM interprets bytecode and runs it on any OS.

This separation is why Java runs the same on Windows, Mac, Linux.

3. Important Java Terms

JDK (Java Development Kit): tools + compiler.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): everything required to run Java apps.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): runs your bytecode.

JDK = JRE + developer tools.

4. Java Characteristics

Object-oriented (everything revolves around classes and objects)

Statically typed (you must specify variable types)

Secure (sandboxed execution)

Robust (automatic memory management with Garbage Collection)

Multithreaded (can run tasks in parallel easily)
